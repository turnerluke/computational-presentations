# computational-presentations
A repository of my presentations teaching computational coursework to chemical engineering undergraduate students.


In spring 2021 I had a fantastic opportunity to teach a discussion section for our computational course for chemical engineering undergrads. The course was my first eposure to coding, and was one of many motivations to become a data scientist. This semester was the courses first exposure to Python, a push I am proud to say I was prominent in motivating.

While these presentations were made to compliment coursework and might not stand exceptionally well on their own, I beleive they can be followed by anyone looking for some intermediate-level coding challenges for science and engineering applications.
